# Quadratic Function Analysis

## Objective
To implement a Python program that analyzes quadratic functions, computes derivatives, identifies critical points, and visualizes the functions.

## Tasks

### 1. Write a Dynamic Function for Derivative Calculation
Create a Python function that calculates the derivative of any given function with respect to a variable `x`.

### 2. Test the Derivative Function with an Equation
Define an equation of your choice that has at least two minima and two maxima. The plot of the function should show at least 4 points where there are maximas and minimas.

### 3. Plot the Graph of the Equation
Implement code to visualize the equation defined in Task 2. Use Matplotlib or other plotting libraries to create a graph of the function.

### 4. Identify Minima and Maxima
Create separate arrays to store the x-values of minima and maxima of the function. Print these arrays to display the critical points of the function.

### 5. Compute Global Minima and Maxima
Determine the global minima and maxima of the quadratic function. Print the coordinates of these points to identify the overall minimum and maximum values of the function.

### 6. Visualize the Global Minima and Maxima
Plot the graph of the quadratic function along with markers indicating the global minima and maxima. Ensure that the markers are visually distinguishable on the graph.
